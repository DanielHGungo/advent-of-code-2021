I recommend installing Node for JavaScript runtime. 
This removes the need for using dev tools or html to run javascript in browser. 
execute js files with command:
node your-file.js

alternatively if you want to log the output to a new txt file
use command:
node.exe your-file.js > your-output.txt

this will overwrite the txt file if it currently exists.
